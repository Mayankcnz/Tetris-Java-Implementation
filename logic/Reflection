Reflection 


Good Points -:

Unlike last assingnment in this assignment i avoided hardcoding. I spent time planning the solution first then implemented it


Bad Points

I but i realised it in the end that i could have done isValid in translation method specifically in a more elegant way, which would probably be half the size 
of solution of now.
